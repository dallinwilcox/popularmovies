This app references themoviedb.org and requires an API key provided by themoviedb.org
which should be kept private in accordance with the terms and conditions.

The API key for TMDB should be defined as a string resource named tmdb_api_key.
I defined mine in app/src/main/res/values/api_key.xml which is already added to the .gitignore
to prevent accidentally adding it to the repo.
